The project involves analysis of data pertaining burnout undertaken in the health care industry.

The reason I chose this subject for study is as a result of my own experienvce with burnout.

Main questions from the analysis:
 - what are the main contributers to burn-out?
 - Insights into the methodoligy used to assess burnout?
 - What represents a burnout score which should be a concern to employers
 - Is there any insights that can be drawn from the data to conclude burnout affects different genders less or more
 - What limitations do the data show?
 - Although not part of the main goal of the project, I will aim to show the relationship between burnout, anxiety and depression 

 Furture work: I would like to create a application to survey any work force on established metrics with the goal to identify employees with mentl health issues which will hopefully drive proactive engagement by employee wellness and HR departments and shape culture, policies and procedures to ensure a good level of mental health is maintained.
